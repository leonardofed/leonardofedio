How do we get ourselves out of the foreground of our thoughts and achieve compassion? The speech captures Wallace's electric intellect as well as his grace in attention to others.</p> <h3 id="thinking-fast-and-slow"><a href="#thinking-fast-and-slow" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Thinking, Fast and Slow</h3> <p>The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.</p> <h3 id="antifragile-things-that-gain-from-disorder"><a href="#antifragile-things-that-gain-from-disorder" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</h3> <p>Antifragile offers a definitive solution: how to gain from disorder and chaos while being protected from fragilities and adverse events. For what NNT calls the &quot;antifragile&quot; is one step beyond robust, as it benefits from adversity, uncertainty and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension.</p> <h3 id="the-theory-of-moral-sentiments"><a href="#the-theory-of-moral-sentiments" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Theory of Moral Sentiments</h3> <p>Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments consists of his reconstruction of the Enlightenment idea of a moral, or social, science that embraces both political economy and the theory of law and government. His articulate expression of his philosophy still continues to blow my mind years after my first read.</p> <h3 id="the-wealth-of-humans-work-power-and-status-in-the-twenty-first-century"><a href="#the-wealth-of-humans-work-power-and-status-in-the-twenty-first-century" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Wealth of Humans: Work, Power, and Status in the Twenty-first Century</h3> <p>None of us has ever lived through a genuine industrial revolution. Until now.
Past revolutions required rewriting the social contract: this one is unlikely to demand anything less.</p> <h3 id="fooled-by-randomness"><a href="#fooled-by-randomness" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fooled By Randomness</h3> <p>An investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand.</p> <h3 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-building-a-business-when-there-are-no-easy-answers"><a href="#the-hard-thing-about-hard-things-building-a-business-when-there-are-no-easy-answers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers</h3> <p>A lot of people talk about how great it is to start a business, but this is only brutal honest book about how actually hard it is to run one.</p> <h3 id="how-to-talk-so-kids-will-listen-and-listen-so-kids-will-talk‎"><a href="#how-to-talk-so-kids-will-listen-and-listen-so-kids-will-talk‎" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk‎</h3> <p>Understand children minds to better understand humans. How they think, how they behave.</p> <h3 id="enchiridion"><a href="#enchiridion" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enchiridion</h3> <p>Descriptions and perscriptions on how to better act, behave and understand the world from more short manual that stood the test of time.</p> <h3 id="several-short-sentences-about-writing"><a href="#several-short-sentences-about-writing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Several Short Sentences About Writing</h3> <p>If you think you write bad, read this. If you think you write well read it twice. Most of what you think you know about writing is useless. It’s the harmful debris of your education—a mixture of half-truths, myths, and false assumptions that prevents you from writing well.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
