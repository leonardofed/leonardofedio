One of the best examples of this is the story of the map of the <em>London Underground</em>.</p> <p>The London Underground officially opened in 1863. Despite being such a revolutionary way for moving people around the city, the Underground Electric Railways Company still had to convince people to actually use it.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7Kk87WFAUdL0WyPeg_2ZBg.png" alt></p> <p>The map was a perfect representation of the city. It was precise and detailed, and different colors were used to indicate the different lines, with circles to highlight the various stops.</p> <p>However, Londoners found it too complex and confusing.</p> <p>Over the next 10 years, a variety of geographical maps were produced. They changed sizes, lines widths, colors, fonts, legends over and over again.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xwoD7AB4M0TlZauhbaaQoQ.png" alt></p> <p>In, 1931 the operators took a chance on a new, &quot;radical&quot; map designed by a former <em>Underground Electric Railways Company</em> draughtsman and printed a few copies. His name was <em>Harry Beck</em> and this was his map.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VLJV1E9J85_RWBNEEMtlwQ.png" alt></p> <p>Beck's Tube Map</p> <p>Beck came up with a completely new design with:</p> <ol><li>Only 45- and 90-degree angles.</li> <li>No geographical references: No streets, no parks, no churches.</li> <li>Stops were represented with equal distances.</li></ol> <p>Beck's map was completely different from the actual world, which has all kinds of angles, streets, parks and churches, and where distances matter. While in theory, he introduced a few misleading rules, in practice he removed the clutter, he dramatically reduced the signal to noise ratio and he made the underground more accessible and understandable to humans. Quite simply, it worked.</p> <p>Today, the London Underground map is by far the most famous map in the world. Years later, it became the standard for every underground in the world.</p> <h2 id="the-danger-of-me-too-thinking-and-the-survivorship-bias"><a href="#the-danger-of-me-too-thinking-and-the-survivorship-bias" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The danger of me-too thinking and the Survivorship Bias</h2> <p>In the era of SaaS and digital products, our strongest convictions are powerfully swayed by what other businesses are doing.

The fewer refunds you have, the better.</p> <p>When every other retailer was trying to drive down returns, Zappos chose to optimize the process, making the return not just a normal part of shopping, but a delight.</p> <p>While looking at the wrong proxy metrics can distract organizations from the real benchmarks that do matter, things can get seriously worse when they optimize for those bad metrics. This is where adopting the wrong metrics (and optimizing for them) can seriously affect your growth and negatively impact your customers.

In time, this leads to a death spiral of misplaced attention; the longer you focus and optimize irrelevant metrics, the further and further away you move from the metrics that do matter for your business.</p> <p>Before you know it, you will find yourself trying to desperately justify your new content strategy, your new product decisions, your new customer support line. You will eventually realize that your business hasn't improved because you've spent too long looking at the wrong benchmarks for success.</p> <h2 id="the-need-for-holistic-thinkers"><a href="#the-need-for-holistic-thinkers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Need for Holistic Thinkers</h2> <p>When Harry Beck created his Tube map, he really did just one difficult thing: He was able to understand what users needed. He realized that a more detailed map placed a higher cognitive load on the user, making it more difficult for them to make a decision.</p> <p>Instead, he created a map that didn't look like a map at all. We need people who are able to go beyond the prevailing wisdom and common standards. When they pick up their core metrics, they need to be able to think about their organizations, their products and their strategies in a holistic way.</p> <p>We need people who truly understand customer behavior and who are great at optimizing for the value delivered rather than magician good at optimizing for short-term value. We need companies who truly understand that marketing, product and customer support go hand-in-hand as one big organism and who are focused on constantly improving their customer experience rather than merely lifting up industry-approved metrics.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
