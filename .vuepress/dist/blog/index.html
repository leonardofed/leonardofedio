What’s working today may no longer work a year from now. In the era of SaaS and digital products, opportunities get saturated, best practices become overused, everything suddenly becomes highly measurable, more predictable, and over optimized. Things that we relied on become less effective over time and its efficiency fades out.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/cognitive-load.html">Minimizing the cognitive load in your life</a></h2> <p>Prescriptions on how I minimize the cognitive load in my life, avoid Zeigarnik effect and keep myself accountable for things.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/social-capital.html">On Social Capital</a></h2> <p>Social capital shapes the way people behave at work. It’s a system that includes all the behavioral patterns that live in our heads. It’s the human coding the governs the flow of information.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/saas.html">The Next Generation of SaaS Won’t Optimize for User Engagement</a></h2> <p>A counter-intuitive post I had in my mind for a while, where I explained my thoughts on the next generation of SaaS products. While today's prevailing wisdom is maximizing user engagement, I argued that this might change very soon and for a lot of SaaS products, engagement/usage will be a lagging metric.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/psychology-of-cx.html">The Psychological Implications of Customer Experience</a></h2> <p>A thoughtful provocative analysis on what really means Customer Experience, why it's all but a new idea and why most companies get it wrong. I then delve into the concept using the prospect theory, the customer's subjective value and the  probability weighting function.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/metrics.html">Metrics That Matter</a></h2> <p>All metrics are shortcuts. When we're faced with uncertainty, we use metrics to break our problem down into simpler, tangible pieces that we can understand. Metrics are simple proxies that allow us to transform difficult questions into empirical, demonstrable ones.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/akerlof.html">From Asymmetry to Symmetry of Information</a></h2> <p>Sometimes marketers trick themselves and fall in love odd definitions. You've probably heard that &quot;help is the new selling,&quot; as if it's something new. But is it, really? Isn't this what salespeople have been doing since ever? In thinking about this, I've had a chance to think about how the role of sales is changing.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/microservices.html">Microservices as a Future Approach to Marketing Tech</a></h2> <p>Kielbasa tenderloin boudin bacon cupim, pastrami strip steak rump picanha meatloaf venison meatball ribeye. Burgdoggen t-bone jowl venison biltong andouille. Turducken shankle tongue landjaeger drumstick, pancetta porchetta. Brisket ham turkey andouille picanha. Pancetta chuck shank ham.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/fosbury.html">Fosbury effect and the idea of progress</a></h2> <p>Back in 2011 I read a story about a certain guy that I never heard of before. He was an an high jumper and his name was Richard Fosbury. That story eventually became one of the was the best story I’ve read in 2011.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/ai.html">AI implications on Marketing and Analytics</a></h2> <p>Big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We're in the middle of an obvious one right now.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/saas-stack.html">The Modern SaaS Stack and the Unexploited Amount of Data</a></h2> <p>The SaaS landscape kept evolving fast. New communications channel, new advertising platforms, new ways to talk to your customers, different ways to get new users. Until the moment where each company department adopted its own stack of SaaS products. With such products fragmentations comes data-fragmentation that leads to a massive amount of unexploited data.</p> <br></div><div><h2><a href="/blog/setup-aws-account.html">Proper setup of a new AWS account</a></h2> <p>Kielbasa tenderloin boudin bacon cupim, pastrami strip steak rump picanha meatloaf venison meatball ribeye.
