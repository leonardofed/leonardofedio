With this in mind, how is this &quot;customer experience&quot; idea something new?</p> <p>Well, in fact, it's not new at all.</p> <p>Customer experience is actually the old marketing. &quot;Old&quot; not because it's no longer cool but because it's at the core of fundamental marketing practices. Retail and consumer marketing introjected this idea, not yesterday, but years ago.</p> <p>Take, for instance, Nordstrom and how they <a href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/119531651-how-nordstrom-made-its-brand-synonymous-with-customer-service-and-how-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapped the experience<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> of their customers so that they could continuously support it every step of the way.

Their stores are typically a hassle to get to (especially for city dwellers), and good luck finding a parking spot close to the door. For most any piece of furniture that you buy, you have to assemble it yourself! The entire experience reeks of deprivation. But you also get things you don't expect from a furniture company. Being able to drop your kids off in a clean and brightly lit care center while you shop is just one perk.</p> <p>Customer experience is the bedrock of modern marketing and it's where marketing itself has its roots.</p> <p>So, why am I seeing so many articles describing &quot;customer experience&quot; as a new way to do modern marketing?</p> <p>Aren't they serving the same customers who buy software and cars and all the other experiences that brands are selling us? Aren't those customers humans too?</p> <p>So why are we hearing all this talk about customer experience as the &quot;new&quot; marketing?</p> <p>Let's take a step back and define what Customer Experience (CX) truly is.</p> <blockquote><p>Customer experience (CX) is the product of an interaction between an organization and a customer over the duration of their relationship. This interaction is made up of three parts: the customer journey, the brand touchpoints the customer interacts with, and the environments that the customer experiences (including the digital environment) during their experience. A good customer experience means that the individual's experience during all points of contact matches their expectations.</p></blockquote> <p>This is how Wikipedia defines customer experience: It's the result of the interactions between an organization and a customer over the duration of their relationship.</p> <p>So, if &quot;customer experience&quot; has always been part of the equation, why is it suddenly being touted as something new?</p> <p>In reality, this is not new — it's just different.</p> <p>It's also different from what most businesses do. As customers, we don't like cold calls from sales reps, we hate spammy promotional emails that clog up our inboxes and give us nothing of value, and we hate the idea of someone who's selling to us rather than helping us achieve our goals — not theirs. We hate all of those things, but if you're in marketing or sales, we end up doing the exact things that we hate.</p> <p>That's why it sounds different.</p> <p>Before we dig in further, we need to take a step back to understand the world of today's marketing from a broader perspective.</p> <p>In most companies, marketing people are obsessed with generating more leads, more signups, more downloads, more purchases, more of everything.</p> <p>In this way, marketing becomes a purely tactical activity with the overriding objective of maximizing leads. Everything is judged through the lead generation lens where more means better.</p> <p>This whole thinking is completely separated from the customer experience. Instead of thinking about customers, you are thinking about achieving your organization-centric objectives.</p> <p>Often, companies' goals and users' goals aren't just different, but mutually exclusive.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YMDfa9VeRwPq3wsuNuslmQ.png" alt></p> <p>Most companies put a tremendous effort into creating awesome marketing materials, super effective landing pages, extremely catchy ads and so on. Paradoxically, when they get money from users, they start paying less attention to the customer and shift their interest to the product.</p> <p>We get their attention, we get them in front door, but what about after they pay? We consider the &quot;transaction&quot; closed, done, operation terminated, and it's on to the next one.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VhCRAUn61iwhwMAmYFb1YA.png" alt></p> <p>From that moment on, every experience that the user has with the company is only about the product itself.</p> <p>Think about it.</p> <p>After our customer has given us money or has signed on to receive our service, we shouldn't just stop there. Instead, we should focus even more on what our customer really wants to do.</p> <blockquote><p>They don't want to be badass at our product. They want to be badass at what they do with it.</p></blockquote> <p>It's this shift in perspective that most companies just don't get.</p> <p>Even if it sounds obvious, it's not.</p> <p>Most companies are trying to compete on the quality of the product, not on the quality of the user's results with the product.</p> <p>Customer experience is about two main things: perspective and empathy.</p> <h3 id="perspective-customer-experience"><a href="#perspective-customer-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Perspective: Customer Experience</h3> <p>One of the best examples I've seen recently is from <a href="https://medium.com/@FullStoryHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>'s <a href="https://medium.com/@amy_e_ellis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Ellis<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> in a lecture at <a href="http://www.forgetthefunnel.com/workshops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forget The Funnel<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <p>In this <a href="https://my.demio.com/recording/HKTaNrD1?__s=jsjs74afntnje9chpmzf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-minute video<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> (which I'd recommend watching), Amy explains her thought experiment with the analogy of a dinner party.</p> <p>Image that you're hosting a dinner party. You start by thinking about all the things you would need do in preparation for the dinner party, all the components you need to make it happen.</p> <p>Think about your &quot;thinking&quot; approach: it's a checklist. You break things down into tasks and subtasks.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DIoNkwOfy2V4cFL18pH1jg.png" alt></p> <ul><li>How to get the food</li> <li>When you need to start cooking each dish</li> <li>How you will decorate the table, and where everyone will sit</li> <li>What kind of wine you will serve</li> <li>Etc..</li></ul> <p>In making your list, these are all necessary &quot;puzzle pieces&quot; that you'll use to assemble your dinner party.</p> <p>The problem with this approach is that you tend to give the same importance to all the pieces of your puzzle. If one of them is missing you cannot complete the puzzle. As a result, each item on your list feels equally important.</p> <p>Time to switch gears. Now, pretend that you're not the host, but one of the invited guests.</p> <p>Your first touchpoint with the party will probably be an invitation from the organizer. This should answer some of the questions that you probably have, such as:</p> <ul><li>When is the party?</li> <li>Where is it? (And can I take the bus or the subway?)</li> <li>What is the dress code?</li> <li>Who else is invited? Will I already know the other guests?</li> <li>Do I need to bring anything? Should I also bring a gift?</li></ul> <p>What will be the next touchpoint and will it answer the other questions that you may have?</p> <ul><li>A reminder email or postcard would be useful so I don't forget about the event.</li> <li>Is there plenty of parking available or will I need to pay for it?</li> <li>Will I be introduced to people I don't know?</li> <li>When I get there, what should I do with the gift that I bought — should I leave it with someone?</li></ul> <p>As a guest, your decision-making process is a completely different. It may look something like this.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gWKxSI-d6SlLssgW2BJ5qQ.png" alt></p> <p>What has changed? You're playing a different game that requires a different series of steps. Like playing chess, you're evaluating combinations for every possible variation. It's no longer about checking tasks off a list, it's more of a thinking exercise.</p> <p>Now, compare the two scenarios. Details that are important to the host are quite irrelevant for the guest.</p> <p>To take this a step further, we need to empathize with our user.</p> <h3 id="empathy-customer-experience"><a href="#empathy-customer-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Empathy: Customer Experience</h3> <p>For hundreds of years, value was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_utility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed to be  linear<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.

Then, think about what your customers expect, the things that, for them, are an obvious step in their journey. These are pitfalls where you risk losing credibility, and may be more harmful than you think.</p> <p>An increase in the probability that a certain event will happen is a shift from concave to convex.</p> <p>In marketing, we see this happen when a certain tactic gets formulated and applied on a larger scale. It ceases to be a positive and unexpected event (concave) and instead gets commoditized and translated on the convex part of the function where the perceived value is proportionally inferior.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*I0aequVvlQFzqk_rwQ10iQ.png" alt></p> <p>The specific fatigue that I'm talking about here is a translation between <em>x0 <em>⊆</em> A</em> (concave) and <em>x1</em> ⊆ <em>B</em> (convex) has some common touchpoints with the <a href="https://www.generativeart.com/on/cic/GA2010/2010_31.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wundt-Berlyne curve.<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>When a stimulus is unlike anything encountered before, we are dealing with absolute novelty, and we experience pleasure.
